This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R involving data frame subsetting.  When attempting to subset a data frame using column names that don't exist, R silently returns a data frame with fewer columns than expected, without raising any warnings or errors.  This can lead to difficult-to-debug issues later in the code. The `bug.r` file demonstrates the problem, while `bugSolution.r` provides a solution using error handling.
